At this point, I don't know how to write a blog, not that my previous ones were top-notch, just that I don't get ideas with the flow, the brain has become rusty when it comes to writing nowadays.

A lot happened in the past few months, got vaccinated, went through an emotional roller-coaster, struggled to get a job, got a job, moved to a new place, met some cool people on the internet, bond with some old ones grew stronger and weaker with some, worked on some small projects which I liked a lot and apart from all this I left Instagram which gave me immense pleasure.

Two of the biggest shifts were, getting an offer letter and moving to a new place. I will write more about the job and stuff once I've survived the probation period. I wanted to write about moving to this new place, but not about the new place but more about how the old place impacted our lives in so many ways.

We used to live in Palam, a nice area, close to the airport, nice connectivity with the city, Delhi anyway has the best public transport and that's a fact! We moved to Palam in 2011-12 not sure, I was in 8th or 9th grade. 

I was in school the day we were shifting to Palam, I reached home by 6pm(2nd shift), most of the things were arranged, Mom asked me to go get some milk from the nearby shop, I went, bought and luckily the shop was just a few steps away from our house and they sold Samosas too! I was happy as in all the places we lived there was no samosa vendor nearby.

We used to go to school in a Van, they used to stuff children in school Van's like mashed potato inside a samosa, there were 10-15 going to school in a Maruti Omni. It was quite an experience, My sister completed here 12th and completed her engineering from the same house, both sisters, We bought our first touch screen phone in this house, it was an iPhone rip off from Spice, they used to sell it on home shop 18, it cost around 2000, and I still remember two incidents regarding that phone, first, Sun Saathiya song from ABCD2 released, I remember downloading it for 13 hours straight because the internet speed was just fluctuating between a few bytes and a few KB's. Second, My 10th board result was announced a couple of days after buying that phone, idk my Mother was quite confident that I would get a 10cgpa, I ended up getting 7.8 I guess. 

It was not a good time, as I was not getting science in the school I was in, so I went to Tamil Nadu and lived with my Father since he was posted there, did my 11th and 12th from Tamil Nadu, which was a  time of my life, enjoyed it a lot, met some amazing people and realised that it's the teachers who can make you fall in love with a subject if curiosity is not enough, these 2 years were great, completed my schooling and joined an Engineering college nearby, spent 3 years in Coimbatore then, I used to go home once or twice in a year, which was fine, life was smooth, nothing major, I fell in love with photography, Dad bought me my first camera, was happy, we also had Chole-bhature in Chandni Chowk that day, it was a nice outing with Dad, we don't mingle too often. 

Pandemic and stuff happened, we were in the same house, I developed a routine, it kept me sane and busy, luckily things fell in place, met some people on the internet who guided me about how to get going with learning, it was a pivotal point, I used to make small web dev projects to get some dopamine hit, I liked creating them, sharing it was tough, I wasn't confident enough to share them with everyone, so I shared that small happiness with a few, and moved on to the next project, may this routing helped me a lot in the job search, college was pretty much non-existent in the last year, they helped with some nice sessions, apart from that regular classes were a pure waste of time. 

The house has seen our family going through many rough stages, we came to know more about each other there, it was good, there were some days our house felt like a home and some days the hope tore apart and became a house again, the situations decide whether we live in a house or a home, it doesn't take much to convert a house into a home, but at the same time it takes a lot, understanding that balance of your family will help you make your house into a home, our house in palam helped us understand that just that most of the time we lived in a house, even tho I wished the opposite, anyhow, at least we know what it takes to make a home. 

There are many indirect memories from that house, but i am not sure if I am willing to dwell in that memory lane, maybe I'll keep those small anecdotes for some other blog. :)
