With all the wrapped and year-end reviews released by our favourite products, and by some 3rd party developers, there were some stats that weren't covered, at least for each individual. Stats like how many hours you slept, when you woke up, how many days did you hit the gym, went for a run or cycling, how many days you didn't skip breakfast, how many days you read at least one page of a book, or how many days you did something which can't be tracked because you don't have a specific device to do so.

For example, I think you can get your reading stats from kindle, sleeping stats from your smartwatch, blogging stats from the platform where you blog and yada yada yada. You get the point, things we plan to make a part of our daily routine or in more generic terms a resolution.

In case you don't have access to some of the above or you don't watch a smartwatch every day, you can make use of a simple tracker sheet on notion which will give a great overview of your habits and activity patterns as shown above.

So how to make this sheet?

You don't have to, I made one, you can clone it from here on your notion. You can find the link at the end of this article.

Play around with different properties, add your custom fields, and finally export the CSV and use some excel formulas to get your yearly stats.
Just a little nerdy thing to do, but who doesn't like stats, and getting some custom stats of your habits every year is cool? I guess.

A happy new year, hope you achieve things you've been postponing this year
