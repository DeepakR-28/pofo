What a silly thing to write about, we all wear shoes, some love them so much that they start collecting them and all, but this one is not about those rich sneakerheads, who spend 80k or lakhs on a single pair of shoes. 

I remember the day I first saw those canvas shoes in the market, I fell in love with them the moment I saw them, didn't buy at that moment because my Bata shoes were too good to be true, I rarely worse shoes so they didn't tear off quickly for me to buy those. 

After a couple of years I bought those canvas shoes and would wear them to literally everywhere, one morning my friend asked me if I wanted to go for a haircut, I said fine, wore them under my 3/4th with those plain white socks, and went to the saloon in that outfit. I was mad after those shoes, unlucky they were not as good as they looked, so we were not able to spend a lot of time together. 

cut to the first year of Engineering when after a long time I fell in love with a brand, Converse.. the one above were the first converse shoes I bought, probably they were a rip-off that I bought from myntra, but anyway they just felt soo good, I have liked t-shirts with funny captions, sweaters with certain patterns, jackets of a certain material, they all never made me fall for them unlike these converse, there is nothing special in the design, nothing that has never been done, way too simple, but this is something about the things we love, we just know we do, there are times we don't know why.

I wore them to college, every single day didn't let anyone touch them, until the 3rd year when I bought a pair of white converse, 
which is probably the last thing I have wished for since 2019( when it comes to clothes and all), also took this picture of me and my dad when we went to buy a camera :), these shoes. Thank you if you reached till here. These are some low effort blogs, which mean something to me, thank you if you read it and find any sorts of interest in it.
