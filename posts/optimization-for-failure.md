How spontaneous have your plans been? I don't know about you, but the last two descent trips I've been to were hella unexpected.
First, the Pondicherry one where my friend lost his phone, so we had to go back home, cancelled all the plans, and when I went to Rameswaram, quite opposite of the same thing happened. 
I left for Thanjavur, reached there by 6 in the morning, without any clue of What am I gonna do after seeing the Big Temple. I was standing at the bus stop for my bus to reach The Big Temple. While waiting, I asked the locals about things to do here and all. I asked one guy how can I reach Rameshwaram from here, he said to me go ask the enquiry counter, went there, realised that there is one train to Rameshwaram at 1 am. I was like voila! this is what I wanted a place to spend the night, booked the ticket, roamed in Thanjavur and Kumbakonam and left for Rameshwaram. 

I was tired after roaming the whole day and slept like kumbakaran on the train, and I realised how careless and how few hoots I give about anything while I'm asleep. I threw my bag on the other birth while sleeping. my wallet, phone, id card everything was in my bag. Someone could have easily taken it without me noticing it. The worst part, I was sleeping when the train reached Rameshwaram. Luckily it was the last stop and I got up after like 10mins of arrival. 

I got down, refreshed my system, prayed to god for that my bag was safe.

Then I went to the Arulmigu Ramanathaswamy Temple. And did the quite opposite of what happened in the Train, left my bag in a locker, took the key and went to explore Rameshwaram. 

Went to places, saw stuff, ate things, and when I was going back to get my bag, which I left so that I could be a bit unrestrained, It was a bad decision for two reasons. 

1. Every time I go to a beach I make sure to pick up some shells for my girl. So since  I was not having my bag, I had to keep all of it in the pocket of my Chinos. and those chinos were already so tight, the shells made my day worse, but you got to do what you gotta do to make the lady happy.

2. While returning from Dhanuskodi, I realised, I could go to Madurai in a passenger hence saving some money for something else. the railway station was between Dhanushkodi and Rameshwaram, and in order catch the train I had to go to the locker, get my bag and head back to the railway station, which was just 2 km away maybe, I had 10 mins to reach there, I had 10 rupees in my wallet so went to the ATM to get some cash. The day got much better, as the amount was deducted from the account but the money didn't come out from the machine, I tried again, withdrew 100 rupees and ran towards the station.

I thought of getting a rickshaw, but they were asking for 100 rupees for just 2 km, I ran and ran and ran, asked for a lift, no one gave, finally got a rickshaw, 1km away from the station, bargained and he took me for 40 rupees, he knew I was in a hurry, he stopped 300m away from the station and said, I won't go any further for 40 rupees.

I felt like swearing but controlled. gave him the 30 and ran towards the station, reached and realized I was late by just 5 mins. 
I was devastated called the bank, they said It'll be added back to the account, and with all the sorrow-filled in me, I saw a bakery, had something called Sukku Pal, and 2 egg puffs, finally I just had 10 rupees left with me, so I went sat at the bus stand and waited for a bus to reach the main bus stand.

Was talking with the locals, waiting there, one of them said, they were also waiting for the bus, one of them was going to Madurai, so he said come with me, Got into a share rickshaw, sat on the front seat and realised, I don't have money left, pockets were filled with shells so I didn't know where I've kept it, I was not even sure If I had 10 rupees for the ride, to escape from embarrassment, I started searching for money in muy pockets and my bag, I was one-speed breaker away from falling, somehow got the 10 rupee note in my bag. paid got down. realised I don't have money for the Bus. had to walk 500m for the ATM again, finally saw one, was taking my money and a guy came inside, local, started seeing me, after everything that happened, I became a little paranoid and started walking out, he then asked me If I could help him in withdrawing Money, I happily did, we both walked towards the bus stand, had a nice little convo with him, he was telling about his kids how they recite English songs what they learn in school, and how they go for fishing and stuff. It was wholesome learning about his Kids. Aw man wanna get married ðŸ˜‚. Then finally boarded the Bus for Madurai and went back to college in Coimbatore.
One fine trip came to an end.
