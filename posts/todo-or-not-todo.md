"Nike's" tagline "just do it" is something many people by,  whatever obstacle comes at you, overcome it, fine, things will be smooth sailing, but what if, when u just can't do it? or just can't reach the solution/aim after multiple attempts? Can't match up to the level you want yourself to be at? things go downhill from there, from just do it, it becomes, can't do it, then comes in self-pity and guilt to attack your mental state. WHICH IS NORMAL. people judge themselves, it's sometimes tough to live with your own brain, where you can't escape the void and keep falling inside it. Simple things get trickier after that. 
Failing is a beautiful pain when u start learning to code, it's the errors that teach you more and more, and once you know why it occurred, then voila, you know how to tackle that particular error and the chances of making the same error again reduce exponentially. 
Imagine playing a videogame, when the boss comes out, it is tough to defeat him/her in the first go, it's the practice and continuous battle that teaches us more about how to defeat that boss. 

Considering the final aim/solution like the Boss, approach a problem, get stuck? your friends are your cheat codes, google, anyone with some experience more than yours, approaching them is half the problem solved.

In your way to killing the boss, you may feel frustrated and think, Nah I can't do it, take some rest, because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. 

Approach slowly, taking baby steps made me realise the meaning of slow and steady wins the race, rushing through a course, or subject is just gonna waste your time and energy, take it slowly, understand, take breaks, and finish it with satisfaction.

The problem arises when you are falling inside the void, what to do then? I can't say what comforts you, because it's not a hat that one size fits all. what I do is talk to someone who'll understand me, almost every time it's the people closest to me, with whom you can be your most vulnerable self. It takes time to build stuff, and sometimes when you let out your feelings you realise you are not alone with that feeling in this world, there are people who are going through the same phase where they are being hard on themselves, it's fine, let things out, write it down somewhere, start a blog if you want to take your mind off things. do what you like, and in case you don't get something to do, remember cooking and eating is therapeutic, try that. You might be able to distract your mind, 
so to do or not to do? Just do it, and if you are not able to take a break, and try again with some help.
