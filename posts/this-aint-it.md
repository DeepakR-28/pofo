I watched the India v Pakistan game today, 110k spectators, 130k including all the staff was present there. Amazing game, like every other India-Pak game. I was thinking about how Kohli finished that t20 wc game by hitting 2 sixes in Haris Rauf's over and helping us inch closer to victory. There were 90k people in the groud, and he sealed victory in a crunch situation. He must've felt like a god at that time, or maybe not because they are trained to control emotions in these moments.

Thinking about these things, i'm wondering how i won't be able to experience even a small percentage of what these people do. It's amazing, it made me think about what am i doing with my life, and I wondered that, this ain't it. I'm not making the best out of the every every passing day. Life is a beautiful gift, we are able to witness so many beauties, and just wasting all of this just doesn't add up. 

I want to go out more often, i've started working from an office, so don't get much time, and this is something I am looking forward to, people are so caught up in thing that they don't even realise. I am one of those, even after writing this, i know i won't be following it, probably will just end up sleeping because it's 2am while I am writing this.

I am not doing justice to what I have received, from nature, family and love.
