The last few weeks have been really bad, spirits were as low as prices of stocks after a market crash. The primary reason was not being able to get a job, not getting enough replies from recruiters, companies ghosting me, and also the general things in life. Everything seemed to work against me, at least no one in my family was infected, well, I was grateful for that at least.

It's kind of tough to keep moving on, it's a bad feeling seeing your friends getting placed, working, earning, obviously, I am happy for them, but there is a feeling of being left behind, after a while imposter syndrome kicks in, you judge yourself based on what other's are achieving. A random Linkedin post is enough to trigger anxiety and existentialism. Everyone has their W's and L's, but in the bad times it becomes tough to focus on your own W's and for some reason, it becomes very easy to doubt yourself over someone else's W. You are lucky if you have someone to share these feelings with, someone to remind you that you are sufficient and what you're doing matters.

How to get over this phase then? to be honest, I haven't and still in that phase, but luckily some good things happened today, which gave me enough strength to jot this down.
I wasn't particularly good at handling this feeling. I then thought what are the things in my control? let me start by changing them first. So as a CS student, one of the few things I have in my hands is upskilling myself, tbh I hate the word upskilling, I would rather say, I am learning things that I'm interested in. So I continued to do that, but learning something can become overwhelming at times, because of the content, it might push you back, but then, to avoid that you can start celebrating small wins, that will motivate you to move forward. 
A small W can be anything, I made my first API call, a simple GET request, but it was nice to see some data fetched from the internet because of the code I wrote. I was lowkey happy which allowed me to move forward with some excitement. Like that I decided to enjoy small things, like connecting components in a webpage, creating links/routes and all, these sorta stuff. these kept me sane.
Another thing that I'm doing now is wake up by 7 or 8 which gets kinda hectic when I go to sleep at 2. 
I have noticed sleeping around 5-6 hours might affect overall productivity, and make you feel drowsy, to which I decided to take a bath every morning and, wash my face every time I felt sleepy while learning. I ended up washing my face almost 4 times a day which is a lot for someone who never took a bath regularly.
These things allowed me to get through the course, I would do the course during the day and would apply for jobs before calling it a day. 
I was kinda satisfied after completing the course. but I was well aware that I would have forgotten some concepts. So I decided to do small projects to get my feet wet as a stepping stone for creating bigger ones.
I am currently doing them, and still celebrating small wins. as long as the imposter syndrome is considered, it's gonna stay but I have realised the fact that I have to write my own story and not get validation concerning someones. Also, a kind human on the internet said that you can't know everything, and comparing yourself to others is one of the worst things you'd do to yourself, imagine the way your parents compared you to your friends, did you like it? so why are you doing that to yourself?

I gave an interview today, which went quite great, just like the last one where the company ghosted me, I was genuinely happy after the interview and god knows after how long I felt confident. Just hoping for the best, and let me know if you are feeling low, we will feel low together. :)
