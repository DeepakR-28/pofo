```
tch
/tʃ/
exclamation
used to express irritation, annoyance, or impatience.
"‘ Tch, tch! I was afraid something like this would happen.’"
 ```
 
Have you ever tch’ed before going to sleep? I do it almost every other day nowadays, yesterday was when I realised that I have this habit. I went to sleep around 12, I tch’ed the moment I laid. I realized it has been going on for a while now, what were the reasons for tch’ing yesterday? I don't know to be honest. It just feels like under-delivering everything I promise myself, and without doing those particular things I go to sleep, which does nothing but adds to the guilt.
I do try to get things done during the day, I sit down, open my laptop, go thru the day, attend classes, am not so attentive, solve problems, try to improve algorithms, I don't even know If I have made any progress since October, I have solved more problems since then, but not enough to be confident with concepts. Then there are placements going on, where I am not able to clear the first round of some companies, and the places where I do clear them are just not what I want. I know what my level is, I know what I am capable of right now, that is the reason why I say no to certain roles, It is never that "I am too good for this role", this is not the thought that crosses my mind before saying no to a certain role, It is just a belief that something better might be there since there is time.










These wires are something that displays what goes on through my mind throughout the day. Thoughts starting from somewhere, going somewhere, losing track midway, and sometimes not even reaching the destination.

Fast forward 11 months.

This blog was in draft for 11 months, I published it on 29th Jan 12:23 AM. A lot of things have changed since then, life work and other areas. Went through a really bad phase at the beginning of 2021. Placements were the biggest concern, sleeping every day with the thought that I am not doing enough, Imposter syndrome became a part of my daily vocabulary, I disconnected myself from people, barely talked to people at home, felt like a failure every day. I knew there was just one way out, and that was practising and filling the gaps. I would keep my head down and work towards that goal, luckily by June I got an offer, wasn't a really attractive one, but I knew what to do to improve, and 2021 gave me a lot to introspect and improve, met some nice people, gained some clarity have set some goals, working towards them.
A lot has changed, I don't tch while going to sleep nowadays, now I do that during the day, but there is a bit more clarity since the last time I wrote this blog, this feels like time travelling.
I am happy now I guess, but still have to do a lot to adjust some priorities but I am way out of that phase that I was in when I started writing this blog in January.
Hope you guys find something where you know why you tch, instead of tch'ing in a gloomy phase.

thanks for reading.
