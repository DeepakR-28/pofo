Wellington 2016, I went to Delhi for my summer vacation, and I did what any 12th std student must have done, took Mathematics Tuition, did just 1 chapter in that 1 month, which was Inverse Trigonometry. 

I love the fact that no matter how scary Inverse Trigonometry sounds, it was one of the easiest chapters in the book. Understand a few formulas and you're done. I did that chapter during my summer vacations, The chapter wasn't taught in our school so I was ready to flex my Inverse Trigonometry problem-solving skills in the classroom.

Our Maths teacher said us to do Inverse Trigno problems for homework, I was never so excited for homework before that day. Did all the questions all answers matched the Book-back Answers, except one. I was very positive about my solution, I knew it wasn't wrong, I checked and rechecked, again and again, I was not able to get the answer on the back of the book. 

The next day I went to a friend, the brightest student in the class, what happened after that was the worst face-palm moment of my life, I felt so so so stupid.

This is what happened, 

The solution that I got after solving the question was 3π/6, but the book-back answer was π/2, I asked him, "Hey see this, I am getting 3π/6 but the back-answer is π/2, I have spent hours trying to get the final answer but no luck, what do you think is wrong?"  he just took the notebook , cancelled out 3 and 6 in 3π/6 which gave me π/2 and kept it on the desk. He looked at me, didn't say anything while trying to control his laugh, I was standing there feeling so dumb for not simplifying it to its simplest form, we looked at each other and laughed at my stupidity for the whole day, he never missed a chance to remind me about this incident.

I later realized that these overlook all these small things very often, and I started defining those situations as 3π/6 situations, which are so dumb, that you wanna feel bad about yourself and laugh about it at the same time.
