You brought spring in august, arrived when I didn't expect anyone to, and stayed over different seasons. Faced all the storms on your way and still blossomed in every season, blossomed when no one expected you to. A sweet happy flower, a wholesome bundle of joy, a flaming torch of bravery, a gentle breeze but also a rock in the face of adversity. You broke down 'n' number of times but fought back 'n+1' times. Tough times tested you, again and again, but you didn't lose your grace. You stood firm like a tree with deep roots, the roots of kindness, courage, love, warmth, passion, spirit and most of all empathy.

A flower but the size of a tree, spreading not just shade but also the fragrance of generosity even to the ones who care the least, make you the tree of compassion. You deserve the best, you've always given your best, the small furry thicc bundle of joy next to you would agree. He would do anything for you, protect you, save you from any wicked rogue tyrant, protect you from all the antagonists of your life, all because you gave your everything to him.

Life has been tough, every day a new challenge, things haven't been kind to you like you have been to them, but life goes on the right, there are ups and downs, lows and highs, but dwelling over the lows and downs will take you deep in the rabbit hole, a place where even you won't be kind to yourself, a place where you will treat yourself like something that you completely aren't, I will be there, to take you out of that rabbit hole, to show you the up's and highs that you deserve, the landscapes of positivity that you might find missing everywhere else. From there we will go to a pretty little place, a place where your deep roots of humility and empathy will be watered with the abundance of love you've gathered all your life, from people who matter, from achievements you can call your own, from the lives of all the cute living beings you cared about. They will be waiting for you there, in that sweet little place, away from all the gloom, despair, and misery. I would love to walk that path with you, **together**.

Doubt is going to be there, it is always there, a scientist an engineer a doctor and a teacher have to be doubtful, one who doesn't doubt their solutions, their conditions is prepping for failure, you cannot win every day, you have to prepare for failure, for doubt, for the pessimistic thoughts, that is how you prepare to win. When you doubt yourself, you are preparing yourself for a worst-case scenario, something which will keep you far from being delusional and disappointed. As long as you are working towards solving the problems, you are moving towards a better tomorrow, a tomorrow where you are happy with an army of shubbu's. But to reach there, you will fail, multiple times, but the only thing that will help you in moving forward is you. And I know for a fact you have it in you to continue moving while keeping your head high.

You have brought a lot of joy into my life, a lot of wins, and a beautiful journey with its own ups and downs, but the only thing that makes me happy and optimistic is the way we overcame each and every obstacle together, no matter the day date or time, we were in it together, actually. And even tho there has been a fair share of misery that I have caused, we have grown in ways to understand and resolve, which will help us grow. I have always wished nothing but the best for you, on your birthday, today, all I want to say is, I've seen you grow in the time that we have spent together, and I hope to look forward to more of it. Happy Birthday Pucchu, you are a blessing, like I've always said, I wish the best for you, you've made your parents proud so many times, and you have had more highs than lows, always remember that I'll always be there to remind you that. Good girl.
