After moving to Wellington in 2015 I had this realization, I was in awe of people's skills in fields that I was really bad at and wanted to excel in. It started with falling in love with mathematics, there was this 1 guy who was really good at it. He would simplify integrals as if someone was writing a poem, it was beautiful to see him derive and solve stuff on paper. I never felt like this before moving to Wellington, the things that would amaze me were some common stuff like doing a stunt in a game or seeing someone fight. I never developed any sort of passion for anything. There was nothing I wanted to excel at, there was nothing that I looked forward to after waking up.


This changed in 11th, I really wanted to excel in mathematics, I looked up to that fellow classmate and really wanted to be able to solve problems like him. My love for mathematics ended after joining college and the result I got wasn't desired, but I never regretted it because it was the first time I spent time on something I really loved.


Fast-forward to the 4th semester, we were taught python in the 1st semester, I practised a bit, wasn't too interested and was able to do sorting and stuff till the sem end, eventually lost touch and finally forgot almost every concept. I literally asked a friend how to declare a variable in python in the 4th semester when I had to learn it again for an event. It was really embarrassing because we don't declare variables in python, we had a good laugh followed by some existential crisis. 


There was this kind guy who helped me in that event, he was ready to teach me some python and problem solving basics. I threw doubts at him and he cleared it after college. This is the 2nd instance when I was in awe of someone's craft. The way she wrote code, and solved a problem was similar to the guy who simplified integrals in 12th. Beautiful, I was not in love with python or programming as such, but felt really guilty calling myself a CS engineer who couldn't even solve problems, which made me want to excel at this, I am still nowhere close to being really good at programming, but I fall in love with beautifully written code and solutions. As someone said that "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.". I am a fool currently, i write code that only a computer can understand, but I am always up to writing better code which even a beginner could understand.


Anyway, he was someone who I looked upto while in college, i was lucky to have people who helped me in different learning phases.

As I am learning this stuff there are times when I have to give presentations, and each and every presentation that I have given till now, related to academics, required me to do multiple revisions and then present.

But luckily there is something, I think I was half decent at, something which grew on me without putting much effort. I wish it was something related to academics. If you've read a few blogs here you might be thinking that I'm talking about photography, hell nah, not even close to decent there, lie somewhere near the mean.

I am talking about presenting my photos, there are 3 or 4 instances where I have presented or talked about photography as my hobby, and not even once I put much effort in making the slides, or going over the content or script, why I never went through the script, cause there was NO script!!. I know the thought process that takes place before making an image, and every time I revisit an image, the same thought process invokes somewhere, and can be translated into words quite easily, that is some sort of clarity that I have. I had a presentation today, where our HR asked us employees to showcase some hobbies, selecting photos took quite some time, and arranging them, but presenting and talking about them seems like something I can do in my sleep. It's nice, and I always have a big smile on my face while talking about them. 

There is just 1 problem, articulating the thoughts before speaking, there are 10 different things I want to say at once. There are times it becomes pure khichdi up there in my mind, but I have started to calm my nerves and give each thought time to develop before speaking them.


This is the only sort of presentation I am confident in and strangely I never prepare beforehand, except selecting a few images. But maybe it's because of some unconscious effort I put into making those images, which indirectly translates here, maybe. I wish to develop this sort of affection for something that I use at work, still waiting, hopefully one day after exploring enough things, because I don't even have a niche yet which scares me at times.


Meeting that guy who helped me with python was not the last time I found myself in awe of someone's skills that I wanted to adopt. 

Recently came across a few blogs of people I met on Twitter where they are so on point while writing, feel effortless, beautiful, 

Art and painting and all are good but since I don't want to be good at it, it does not make me go mad after the art people make. Good presence of mind is something, cracking jokes or puns. I find myself in that scenario where I reflect on a conversation and think "I wish Iâ€™d have said this and regret it for a while. Which makes me feel great about people who have a nice presence of mind and are funny. 

These two things and people who are focused on a goal, I find myself distracted really easily and would like to change that.
