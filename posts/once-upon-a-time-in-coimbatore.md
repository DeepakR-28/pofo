July 2019, we went to the warden, asked for a weekend pass to watch Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It was a night show and our warden helped us in this loophole where we can take a weekend pass saying we are going home, and then go watch a movie, stay at a friends place after that and return to the hostel before the next week.

 It was smooth, one of our friends gave us his Scooty, we left had filter coffee, and went inside the theatre. We booked the front row seats obviously and planned to go back after the interval, we went there, and a security guard came in and started surveying the hall from the entrance, me and my friend both saw him and freaked out, and missed a crux of the movie. he left after a minute or two, Movie got over, we discussed, laughed about how we missed that scene and went to Gandhipuram, to see how busy it was at 2 AM, small hotels were open, and without any doubt, I had the worst parottas and dosas of my life. The worst part was they were selling them at a ridiculously expensive at 2 in the morning, and the taste was inversely proportional. 

Gandhipuram town bus stop was empty, except a few people waiting for their friends and family to arrive, 5 ruba kadai / "5 rupee shop" was open, had tea, took photos of tea, because that is what we do, took the scooter for a stroll, talked about how good the city looks when no one is on the streets, another thing with him is our knowledge and taste in movies is similar, we are not movie buffs when it comes to Hollywood, neither are we beginners, just the right amount of knowledge to discuss and welcome opinions. 

At this point I don't know if I am writing to "Write" or just hungy for better stats, soon the blog is going to complete 5k views, and hope I won't run after views after that, the writing becomes lazier after that,( Since it is lazy already).
