Saapadu or Saapad which means food is something that bonds and divides the people of India, South India food is something that I have missed a lot in this lockdown, back when I used to live in the hostel, I had easy access to South Indian delicacies. 

The simplicity and quality of food that they offer at unimaginable prices, you can have a nice, tasty dinner for just 30 Rupees on a normal day. And the types of dishes they can derive from one basic Ingredient is supernatural. Compared to the North part of the country they probably have better breakfast options, Chole Bhature can destroy any South Indian dish but one can't afford to have it every day, they might end up like a bhature from Saket city mall.

I don't go out to eat very often when I am in the hostel, but one day my friend took me to this hotel/restaurant called Ayyanar mess. Their food and the range of dishes they serve is phenomenal, from Chinese with a  south Indian mix, to authentic Tamil Nadu food, I am not a connoisseur of South Indian food, but I know what good food tastes like. 

They have things like Kari dosa which kind of a South Indian Pizza, but better than any pizza that you can get at that price point. People who make Parotta in the south are known as Parotta Master, making those soft spiral, artistic parotta's is an art, which can only be crafted those masters wearing a lungi and a poomex vest. I have been thru a handful of cities in Tamil Nadu, the poomex vest and Lungi remains common among all those small restaurant owners, they are the heart and soul of the state. 

I love how the South Indian street food has;t had the western and Chinese influence on it, they still have their own creation selling on the streets, like Vazhakaai bajji which is fried raw banana coated in gram flour batter, or something like Mizhaghai bhaji which is green chilli in coated in that same batter. One of my favourites is Paniyaram, which are like softballs, maybe made out of the same batter used to make Idli( I might be wrong), but that thing tastes like heaven, for someone who isn't used to eating it.  you get these anywhere in TN, they didn't have a Chinese fast food influence on their food, yes there are people selling Schezwan dosa and whatnot, but the people who sell that is nothing compared to those who sell those Bhajji's. 

 In the North, the street food scene is quite the opposite compared to the south, people make those Bhajji's in the north and call them Pakore in their houses, there are very few street vendors who sell them in the North, samosas are quite popular but they are also infiltrated with different versions like chow mien samosa or macaroni samosa. Most of the people go out of their houses to eat momo's 10 years ago there were just 3 varients of momo's now they have any possible adjective momos variant, tandoori, cheesy and whatnot. 

I am not a fan of Infiltration on the street food of a particular region, it somehow feels like an attack on the culture, but luckily Old Delhi still has that Old Delhi vibe to it, hope no one tries to steal that. It is one of the nicest places I have been to in Delhi, it is crowded but filled with culture and diversity. Love roaming there in the Old Delhi streets. 

Other than that, Food is the food you can't hate it, like someone said "Every movie is worth watching, but at the end of the day it comes down to one's taste" same is for food, breakfast's South India wins big time, but other than that North Indian food has an upper hand, just because of Rajma, haha, No one can come close to my Rajma, People reached the peak of discovery when they realised Rajma can be eaten, everyone should have given up after that, no one can top it. 



Thank you for wasting your time.
