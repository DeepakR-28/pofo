I never understood fashion shows, people wear bizzare outfits for some reason, maybe to show the designers creativity or some shit like that, never cared enough to look it up on the internet.

However I got a hint when I watched _The Devil Wears Prada_, and if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about the [ceruuuulean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us52N76XA28) scene from the movie.

It didn't change my notion about fashion or fashion shows. I was scrolling on youtube and saw that Kendrick visited a Louis Vuitton Show in Paris, The Fashion Capital of the world. I watched it for kendrick, the concept seemed nice, Kendrick was rapping his new album _Mr Morale and The Big Steppers_. The fashion was again, bizzare, I don't understand it, nor do i care to.

I just simply don't understand, and probably don't even have an intent to understand. But this blog isn't about my understanding of fashion. In [this](https://www.deepakr28.com/blogs/god-object) I explained how going for a run opens my mind to new ideas, and something similar happened today.

Kendrick has a song called "N95" in this new album. Where in one of the verses he explains how the Instagram and influencer culture does not entertain him, and he talks to the people consuming meme's the whole day, about how there is real world outside. 

The line that caught my attention, along with hundreds and thousands of other viewers of this particular fashion show was:


_Take off the Chanel
Take off the Dolce
Take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off
And what do you have? (Bitch)_

Singing this in a fashion show, organized in the fashion capital of the world seems kinda strange. Why would he want to attack these people in design, who are working day and night to make these outfits. Who invest all their heart into it. 

Seems like a direct attack to the whole designing fraternity. And I was happy about it, because Someone I like (Kendrick) attacking/calling out/insulting these people I don't understand (Designers). I felt smart, almost tweeted how Kendrick owned the whole Fashion Industry with 4 lines, but instead lmaoooo'd in the comment section. 

So when I was running today, this song was playing in my head, i knew some of the lyrics, was just thinking about it. Only to realise, how wrong I was. Kendrick sang that as a tribute to Virgil Abloh, an African American Fashion Designer and the impact he had in the world **Apart from the Designing** he did.

So, basically what he meant by those lines were, take off everything you have (The valuables which signal that you are doing well in life like the luxury items) and when you remove those valuables from your identity, what else do you have. Virgil, had done a lot for the community, the industry and the underprivilidged, even if he took the designer shit off, he had a lot more to show, which is unfortunately true for a lot of **INFLUENCERS** these days. 

These people on Instagram dancing on songs, dubbing dialogues, sponsoring products, which have a total 0 visible impact in the society, it is all for the personal gains, take off the million followers mark from your Instagram, what else do you have to show then? Most of them have nothing. 

Same goes for a lot of tech influencers, twitter celebrities posting generic stuff for engagement and Thots getting clout from simps. 
They have nothing to show, apart from that. 

My brain is very slow to comprehend this i guess, but anyway better late than never.
