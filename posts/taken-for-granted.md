I was in 9th grade when one of my cousin’s Father was admitted in a hospital in Delhi, they stayed at our place until the treatment got over, My sister had an android device but she didn’t let me install any games on it. I would come back home, she gave her phone to me from 7pm-8pm, and most of the time I just used Facebook. One of the cousins had an android and I was then exposed to games like hill climb racing, bubble shooter which was kinda addictive and certain apps like Videorder, which meant I didn’t have to add ss in front of the youtube link to download videos(IYKYK). After a couple of weeks their father fully recovered and were about to leave, I loved his watch, it was some Timex brown leather strap one, which analog and digital, he knew I liked it and before leaving he handed it to me, I kept it safe for a year or so, after that I shifted to wellington, and slowly and steadily it just became just another watch for me, The straps came off, there were scratches on the display, I kept it like a pocket-watch. Eventually, I lost it and never thought about it until yesterday.

After 6 months in lockdown, our family was lucky enough to have all the utilities, and didn’t face any sort of major problems like a lot in the world are facing. October 6th we left for our hometown started from Delhi at 5AM and reached home by 6PM, it took me just 3 hours to realize how I just took so many things for granted in Delhi,  I had a table to work on, no Internet Issues, any doubt and I was just one Google search away from getting the answer. Keeping the comfort I had in mind, I am not sure if I utilized it completely, but I am pretty sure I took it for granted.

Same day while going to sleep I was trying to restart my phone and checked If I could get some connectivity, but meh… Airtel and Jio decided to make me regret everything. Lying idle I was thinking how I didn’t care about that watch after a year or so, It was expensive and he just handed it to me to make me happy, in retrospect it is just sad that I didn’t care about it. To be very honest I am just regretting everything whenever I think about it in retrospect, maybe it is the same for everyone, or maybe I am just focusing on the bad, I maybe ignore the good that has happened.

The thing that worries me the most is how many things are there going around me that seem normal everyday stuff but I am just taking for granted, I don’t know what will I do if these everyday things are taken away... I remember losing a watch and after that, I became more conscious about material things.

It is certainly tough for an average human to know the value of everything at the same time, but hopefully, we just get the power to look at the positives when we think about those things in retrospect. Which is nothing but knowing the value of the lamp while it is burning, and not when it is out of oil.
