Breaching the Fortress.

19th January 2021

Exactly 5 days ago the series decider of the Border-Gavaskar trophy was played. After owning the Australian bowling on the 5th day of Sydney test Ashwin, Vihari, Bumrah and Jadeja couldn't make it to the final test because of their injuries. 
"The fortress has been breached" the only words that I remember after pant played the winning stroke at the Gabba, I was so happy, I was clapping for the team alone in my room, watching the match on my phone while I was logged in the online class.
But before talking about how it ended, let me tell you about how it started because those who understood the magnitude of the win would be like, I don't have to read about it from a part-time D grade blogger. I will try to make it as easy as possible to understand. 
Let us start from where we left off, Accomplishing a superhuman task, a draw at the Sydney cricket ground after batting for 131 overs, which is a remarkable achievement, and that too without big names like Kohli in the batting lineup. We conquered Sydney because a draw there was equal to a win for India, a big psychological win because rarely a team loses when the opposition has to bat the whole day on the last day of the match. 
From there, we went to the Gabba with a psychological advantage. India faced some backlash after the draw from some fans saying why are they going for a draw in Sydney because no team can defeat Australia at the Gabba(Brisbane: the venue for the last test), they never lost a test match in Gabba since 1988, and to put it into context, Virat Kohli was just 16 days old when Australia lost their last Test at the Gabba. 32 years have passed no team was successful in defeating them there, hence people started calling it the Fortress. 
India came in for the last Test match, the series decider, both teams won one match each and the 2 months long India tour of Australia still had a lot of suspense for us. 
Australia won the toss and decided to bat, India came on the field with 3 debutants, on a series decider, An interesting statistic from the game, before the start of the play, combined International wickets of the Indian bowling attack was just 13, compared to 1013 Wickets of the Australian bowling attack. 
Now you get an Idea of how inexperienced this team is. 
Rahane went on to play with them, Australia had a decent score on the board, India were 5 down for 165 in the 2nd Innings, and they had 3 debutants, and Siraj and Saini who had played only 2 and 1 tests respectively. everyone felt that we are going downhill from here, Australia will bowl us out, get a lead of 100+, add a couple or a triple hundred more to it in the 2nd innings and continue to guard their fortress, but guess what the debutants played an innings of their life on their debut after India were 5 down after 165, we ended up very close to their score, Australia had a lead of 30 odd runs, they came to bat on the 4th day, added 296 more to it, by the end of the 4th day, and got a comfortable lead of 328. 

India got a target of 328 to chase on the 4th day, After two month of an exciting battle between the two teams, we everything boiled down to the last day of the test match, India chasing at the Gabba.
All the results were possible, Aus winning, Indian winning, Draw if India played thru the day, or a tie if it rains.
Shubman Gill took the charge, owned the Australian bowlers and fielders, made a brilliant 91 and then got caught on Slip. Pujara was batting with him, like the typical Pujara we know, he played two complete sessions and still didn't score his half-century, i.e he played for almost 50 overs without scoring his half-century, it may sound boring, but when you have to bat the whole day, these sort of innings gets you closer to the target. He played and played and played and got out after scoring 56 of 211 balls, we got a someone who could play the role of Rahul Dravid in this Team. 
He left and then Rishab Pant took the charge from there, he played his natural game which is somewhat the opposite of what Pujara does, but this time he was cautious and didn't throw away his wicket.
Slowly and steadily India got closer and closer to the target, this seems like a smooth sailing match, but keeping the Inexperience of the team in mind, and after the 36 All out blunder in the first test match, India bounced back like true champions.
Pant went on to hit the winning runs for India and the last thing I remember from that very moment is Harsh Bhogle saying "India has breached the fortress" Australia lost in Brisbane after 32 years, 
After everything this team went through it will take a book to mention all the special moments from his 1-month test series, This blog will never ever be able to do justice what a Cricket fan might be feeling right now, but I hope some people might understand the circumstances under which we won this series, after losing almost all the senior players, This series turned out to be a fairy tale, a dream, a moment they would want to cherish with fellow lovers of the games with drinks, a story that will be written in gold, a historic day that made us proud of Indian cricket yet again,
