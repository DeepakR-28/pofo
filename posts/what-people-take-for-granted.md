To err is human, which means people who make mistakes must not be treated harshly, after all, it is common for humans to make mistakes, but how easy is it for humans to take something for granted?  

We all must have had some sort of need/wants (very fine line) at some point of life; it might be anything like I wanted a camera after shooting from my phone for 3 odd years. I bought one, I love it, I still do, but do it adore it 24 x 7 the way I first bought it? NAaaaaaa, There were weeks in this lockdown when it was just lying in a corner gathering and gathering dust, the way I love it has changed but not the amount of affection towards it.  There were days when I would sit for hours comparing cameras on different websites and youtube and now that I have it, days just pass when I don't even think about it, but It would hurt like a mofo if I lose it or misplace it, maybe that day I would think how much I took my camera for granted.


The similar thing happened a week ago, but instead of losing my camera I caught a cold, my nose was blocked like Banglore traffic, the first thing that comes to my mind in these sort of situations is how I took my nose and respiration for granted before catching a cold. Both situations lie in the same ballpark.


What if we increase the magnitude of the situation, That is what I think about every time I cross this bridge The whole landscape is at ease, serene and what our gen likes to call is #pEaCEd_oUT.  It is something that everyone living in a city would long for. People save thousands to spend time in between the mountains. I won't compare the perks and cons of living here, but rather about the people who have been living here for years.

Imagine travelling to the mountains, one of the most common things we make sure of is keeping our surroundings clean, keep the waste wrappers in your pocket/bag. The story is a bit different for those living here, you can see wrappers lying everywhere, not complaining, maybe the pollution in the cities is way too much compared to the hills, so we just see throwing the waste on the street as a serious crime as the penalty is also quite hefty. 

One more reason for being too lenient towards littering in the hills is because the landscapes compensate for it.

It is very unfair to say that people here have taken this beauty for granted based on this one incident, there are a lot of hardships that follow while living here, it is very certain that some might get bored, of all the surroundings, for example getting a new camera when you have used the old one to its extent.


People who migrated to the cities(like us) come back once in a while, praise it, write blogs about it, post photos on Insta, send snaps, spend time, and then return to the cities to earn some bread. 

Many return after retirement and try their best to give something back to the village which is something I would love to do, a small step more than donations, not sure what, it is a very long shot, but would love to return here. 

What a disgrace it would be to not return to a place so beautiful, the sun hitting the Himalaya's in the morning is something which you would love to witness every morning, the full moon over them in the evening.

Hope is my driving force, I just hope for the best, not always prepare for the worst, but I just hope if I take anything for granted, I make up for it, I am sure I won't change the affection for people or things, but with time. expressing becomes tough/easier, I hope understanding becomes easier.
