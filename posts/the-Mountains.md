Let me start off with a cliche, "The mountains are calling me and I must go", If you have been on Instagram for at least 4 years, you must have come across this term very often. Almost every other person wants to be like Ranbir Kapoor from Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani, and why not? It is probably the best thing to do while we are alive, roam across the planet, some have bigger ambitions like colonizing mars but let us focus on our planet, or at least our country for this read.

I am from Uttrakhand, the very moment you cross the state borders you are greeted by the mountains, and it's the terrain, no matter where you go in Uttrakhand, you'll be in the arms of the mighty mountains, there are rivers flowing between mountains, cities built on the bank of rivers, roads are so twisty and crooked, that they can put Bingo tedhe-medhe to shame. 

People grow their own crops, have their own cattle, live a life without any glam. 


There are no shortage of beautiful sceneries, everything is serene, But every beautiful thing comes with a  sacrifice, it can never be smooth sailing, there are tradeoffs to be made in almost every field, and when it comes to living in the mountains the tradeoffs are pretty big.
Let us take the roads for starters, you enjoy the roads initially, and then the magic happens in your stomach and your brain, I travel to my native at least once in a year, or sometimes once in years, and not even once I've been able to enjoy the scenery, opening the eyes for a few milliseconds can be a nightmare, so that is the first thing you have to go through in order to reach somewhere in Uttrakhand unless you have a bike then you are sorted.
Okay so now we have reached, what next? everything must be great from now,  well sorry to burst your excitement balloon, now you have to climb the mountains in order to reach home, because centuries ago someone decided to make houses up there in the middle of nowhere, instead of on somewhere near the river.
Once the "hike" is done, with all the luggage on your shoulders and hands, you reach home and relax. but then there are certain realisations which are ready to attack your self-esteem, you spend days there, work a bit, carry things from point A to Point B, get back pain, carry buckets of water from the common tap, then there will be a certain point where you will think, "aiyo my boring daily 9-5 life is better than this", you doubt your self-esteem, think how people do it here all day every day, and time passes by, you get used to it, you roam around, meet relatives, feed the cattle, take them for a bath to a waterfall reserved for buffaloes, shoo away the monkeys, pluck fruits from the tree, sit under the shade and eat, play with friends in the evening, eat and make sure you close the doors by 10PM because tigers are out in the night.
These small joys become a part of life very quickly, and then going back to the city, rush thru the traffic, meet people you work/study with, because no other choice, and probably within a day, you'll think about the time you spent in the hills which is physically challenging, but worth it in the end, 

maintaining a balance is key at the end of the day, you have to rush thru the traffic for months, to just wake up facing the mountains for a few days.

People carry sacks filled with grains to the mill on their back, climb up and down the mountains, but now they are used to it, that is how I calm my self-esteem down, Living and doing everything in a raw manner makes them no less than superhumans.

There is trade-off everywhere, which makes life a bit more interesting, and the simplicity of people living here in the hills is a glam that no superstars can achieve.
