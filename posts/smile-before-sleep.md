It doesn't happen often when I realise that I am smiling while thinking about something, happened a few days ago, I was lying, wasn't able to sleep, there were some fun incidents playing in my mind, very random fun incidents where I and my friend cracked some joke and were laughing about it. I don't know if it was because I was not able to sleep, or because I don't think about all that during the day, but those incidents were playing and I was lying there and smiling. 
There were very minor incidents, probably a joke that I cracked in the classroom, or something I said while playing COD, or something that I did years ago that for some reason my brain still remembers it, these memories were playing one after one, without my control on it, I was just enjoying them. 
Within a few minutes after realising that I am having a smirk on my face I slept. 
It was nice and wholesome, thought of writing it here.
Apart from that, I do daydream, but there are enough things on the monitor to distract me from it within seconds. Looking back in retrospect things that I think I "dreamed" of, for example, building an OS better than windows, selling it and becoming the richest man on the planet after watching the Bill Gates documentary on National Geographic, I don't think of that as dreaming, it probably what I thought the reality was, because they made the documentary in such a way, that it seemed that anyone can build an OS and become rich like Bill Gates, with the knowledge I had about the topic, me thinking of being the richest man wasn't dreaming because I was like "I will" instead of "I wish" now when I have the knowledge about that subject, I think of it as "I wish" most of the times.
For me, the dreams were just everything that happened in the magical world, like Harry Potter and all those Disney movies, I knew it was magic, hence I dreamt of it. 
There is probably a fine line between Ambition and dream, I like the ambition part, I was actually so stupid at one point of time that I changed my Facebook name to "Ambitions Deepak" an account where I posted without any guilt or worries. 
Right now the line where ambitions and dreams fall have become very narrow, let's see for how many more years to come in order to dream again, probably will get some help from some memories I have made.
