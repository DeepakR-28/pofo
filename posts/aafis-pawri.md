Was at an office party yesterday, I'm really anxious about social events, don't like meeting people, skill issue. However, readily agreed to this as my team was also gonna be there, and it's a nice team, kind fellows, like college mates. Reached there, there was unlimited food and drinks, i sticked with coke and sprite and just went bezerk on all the starters. 

The anxiety stays till i havent reached the start line, when i'm there, it doesnt' really matter. I had a great time, danced with the product manager who keeps assigning bugs and brings change requests a day before the release, it was all nice punjabi and bollywood songs, the DJ was kinda whack, the songs could've been better, they were not very pedesterian, and it didn't match the vibe which is required to dance, however had a blast. 

Another reason to be on the dancefloor was to be close to the big screen where they were showcasing the match (South Africa vs Pakistan), It was an amazing game, the target was not really big, but SA almost choked, and won with 1 wicket remaining. Keshav Maharaj as everyone was calling him the "Sanatani King" after he hit the ball for a four with a bat with ‡•ê written on it to win the game for SA.

I was dancing and looking at the screen, wild game, wild dancefloor, pretty wild scenes, loved it, won't really be anxious about future events lol.
