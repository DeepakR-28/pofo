I didn't have any idea what to write about in the last 10 days...

Thank god it's teachers day, finally some content. They were the best part about the last two years in school.

Teachers are a part of our growth since a very tender age of ours. It is tough to remember all of them, even tougher to remember memories which weren't too obvious to remember. 
Oldest school memory must be the one, when I was in LKG I guess and one of our friends brought those orange toffees on his birthday, someone in his family had was bad at maths, and sent him to school with a small packet of those toffees. The students were like thrice the number of toffees available, our class teacher decided to break each toffee into two or three pieces, which was sweet of her but also funny because she was literally biting them off from the wrapper because those toffees are like pebbles. 

I was in 10th when I realised I don't enjoy any of the classes or subjects, we would literally go to school to meet our friends, maybe liked the English class because my friend and I would find the meanings of all the tough words in the chapter which was about to be taken on the next day, we did it because we wanted to flex and also to show-off to the two new girls who joined who were like native English speakers. 

Life till 10th was just going on, nothing special, no involvement in activities, I anyway hate CCA the most, so no crafty skills, basically everything that was being taught was just absorbed for the sake of it. I wasn't conscious about the process of learning till 10th, it was just happening.

But for my senior secondary years which is 11th and 12th, when I shifted to Wellington, the change was drastic, maybe because of the number of students, they were just 18 compared to ~55 in Delhi, things started to change.

I still remember my first day, I was asked to give an intro by our English Sir, spoke something, went back to the bench, sat near Alwin that Idiot left me in the 2nd period to sit on another chair, CS sir seemed "apne jaise", Chemistry Sir, asked for CGPA, shivers went thru and said 7.8, Physics sir... I thought he was teaching in Malayalam, later realised that's his accent, physics was cool, felt curious for 40 odd minutes. and finally our Maths ma'am, I was scared of her in the first class, and I joined when she was taking Sets and Functions which is scary enough to regret the choice of taking maths after 10th.

Happiness went uphill from here, going to school never felt like a burden in wellington, credits goes to so many things, the climate, location, size of the class, people and everything.
But maybe the most important of all, was the way we were learning, sometimes surrounding the teacher, cracking jokes while doing differential equation, relating it with stuff we face in real life, somedays in the open, some days just running around in the computer lab, other days just playing with stuff in the physics lab. when someone says will you miss school life, obvious answers is yes for the fun people have with their friends, I am lucky enough to mention the teachers before the friends. 
Some days our Maths ma'am would ask us to take two tables in the sunlight, and sit by the canteen, sip tea, eat vada and solve problems.

It was mainly because of the atmosphere created by the teachers there, the environment, and if  I had to sum it up in one word it'd be togetherness, no one felt left out there. 
Big shoutout to the teachers who made that warm and healthy environment. 

I came from somewhere where I would have to stress my mind to think out some good memories in school, to a place where I made plenty of memories just by going and coming back form the maths tuition. Our maths ma'am made us fall in love with the subject, somedays we would directly go to her home for tution in our school uniform. She didn't charge anything, it was to wrap up the syllabus quickly and then move on to other books apart from NCERT. Along with each and every beautiful day that went by in our Mam's house, we've got a scolding from her for not adding the +c after indefinite integral solutions, some days we would seek into the next room and watch the match, and on other days we would get biryani for coming to tuition on a Sunday, A teacher like that in the late teenage is a blessing for any student. If I start writing good deeds about all the teachers here on this blog, then it would go on forever, the last two years of schooling was more about getting consciousness about learning, and developing emotions, because no matter what someone becomes, I feel emotions are the ones that one should possess to know where his/her happiness lies.

The only problem was the board examination, I gave my everything to learn maths in 12th, would chug on coffee to complete RD sharma, the excitement levels after solving a problem was like solving a bug after days of debugging. Since I gave my everything to this subject, i cried like a biatch after the board exams, I was being extra cautions because of my handwriting and simple calculation errors that i made previously.
I wasn't able to attent a few questions, tried my best to hold on to those tears outside the exam hall, when i reached home, i shed tears like an open tap. 
However, learning was fun in those days with friends, it was the equivalent of people visiting cafe's and working but we actually studied.

And you know the teachers who taught us were the best when we don't worry about the end of 12th because we have had a relation with them beyond the four walls of the classroom, which sounds like a cliche but is very true. 

Dedicated to the teachers of the lovely school I studied in, a place where I felt there is more to schooling than just studying and passing.
